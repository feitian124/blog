<h2>Work experience</h2>

<h4>2007.07 - 2009.09 Chongqing Information Technology Communication Engineering Co.,Ltd</h4>

<blockquote><p>This is my first company after my graduation from the Central South University.
I didn&#8217;t has a clear aim there and worked as a communication engineer for two years
config and maintainance base station equipment for china moblie; constructe wap gateway
system for china telecome. I learned much telecom ralated knowledge including linux,
database, network equipment. But what is more valuable that i learned may be are those
soft skills: how to communicate with other people; hard work with knowing your responsibility;
resolve the key problem first; be confidence even in a bad situation.
  As the company can&#8217;t provide many chances and i want to work as software developer, i
  left there.</p></blockquote>

<h4>2009.10 - 2010.02 Isoftstone technology</h4>

<blockquote><p>This is my first work as a software developer, and as a out source.
Computer is my majority and i did learn a lot courses, but most of
them are too abstract and theoretic, and what&#8217;s more, i forget some.
I enhanced my java here and learned struts, spring, ibatis&#8211;the most
popolar open source platform. the requirements changed fast, the time
is always limited, people come and go&#8230;the quality of the project is
not very good and i realized that software project is a real challenge.
i refactoried some Jsp and implemented a public query web site for
car claims for the clients.
  I&#8217;m an intern students at first although i have two year experience, and even i passed the
  training and examine, i have to leave because the java team is cut off by client&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<h4>2010.03 - 2010.09 Hangzhou Shidai Yingtong software</h4>

<blockquote><p>Not easy to find a suitable job in Chongqing, i left chongqing and joined this company.
The project is to transfer a C++ C/S based application to java B/S based application.
There are so many documents and code need to check to find the logic. and some C/S feature
is really hard to re-implement in a B/S system. I as team member invovled in some common
module develp, such as login, cache, and CRUD. the most diffcult part maybe is the front-end,
because trees, tables, check-box with many logic such as validation.(Rich Internet Applications,
I learned this word later), many pages has hundres of js code&#8230; I also focuse on the report
module. at here i know that a sql may more than 1000 line long, a table may has 200 columns,
and the nested sql may up to 6 level&#8230; any way, i learned a lot there also so tired.
  This company is so crazy that i must work 6 days a week, and 11 hours a day&#8211;forced and without
  bonus. And if you are late for more than 5 minutes(if i&#8217;m not wrong), half day&#8217;s salary is
  gone. That&#8217;s why i left after i hold the line for 6 months..</p></blockquote>

<h4>2010.11 - today Infosys china</h4>

<blockquote><p>there are two month gap this time because i stayed in an another little company for nealy
one month and then choose infosys, simply because it&#8217;s a large company and a foreign company.
I think this choice is almost right, since if not, this article will not here. And because
my english improved, i fell comfortable to view english document, i learnd a lot by myself
from english documents.
I work in a data warehouse project for the first 18 month, and i developed shell script ability
and learned much Plsql and many oracle knowledge. Work here is not busy, I has much time
to do things i has interested. I begin to lead several people with less experience. And involed
in project management (the offsore team). Transfer knowledge to teammembers. And help recuit
people. I alreday aware tha for large project, what is a key to success is management and the
team, so i pursue this knowledge. And i also find that wireless internet, cloude computing is
important for next 5 or 10 years, i learned android and ruby (on rails) in my spare time.
I become the frequenter of github and google code beside the It website i liked before.
I will focus on VIM as my main editor and Ubuntu is the OS in my daily use.
I hope some day, i can put all these things together, to do something big or make my team much
powerful.
2012.05 because an important client(you can get the answer from my other posts ^_^ ), i changed
my project and changed my base location to Shanghai.</p>
