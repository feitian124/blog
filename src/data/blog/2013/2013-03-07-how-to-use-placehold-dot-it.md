Do you ever heard of `PLACEHOLD.IT` ?  
What's `PLACEHOLD.IT` ? A quick and simple image placeholder service. How does it work?   
Just put your image size after our URL and you'll get a placeholder.    
<!--more-->

Like this: `http://placehold.it/350x150`     
You can also use it in your code, like this:      
`<img src="http://placehold.it/350x150">`   
You will get a image placeholder like below:  
![Placehold for 350x150](/images/350x150.png)   

But markdown does not support defining the height and width for the image.   
so you can choose to use `<image>` tag if need.
Is it very simple and useful? Have fun!
