i want to have my own blog since long time ago, but all kinds of excuses stoped me.
As i'm learning ruby on rails, i'm kind of repick the good habit of study and writing 
things down. It's a good chance to start blog right here, right now. 
I would like to keep my decision here:

1. each week post at least two posts, and at least one of them must be technical related
   in the next 6 month.

2. each week recite at least one article from "new concept english". this not only help
   me improve my english through good habit, but also help me reinforce the memory.
