今天公司的town hall是介绍了一些新技术及公司引入的情况。有钱好办事，公司在这方面还是挺投入的。

## big data
首先说的是big data，什么是big data呢（后来发现不少是引用的IBM的）
### Volume: 
Enterprises are awash with ever-growing data of all types, easily amassing terabytes—even petabytes—of information.
Turn 12 terabytes of Tweets created each day into improved product sentiment analysis
Convert 350 billion annual meter readings to better predict power consumption

### Velocity: 
Sometimes 2 minutes is too late. For time-sensitive processes such as catching fraud, big data must be used as it streams into your enterprise in order to maximize its value.
Scrutinize 5 million trade events created each day to identify potential fraud
Analyze 500 million daily call detail records in real-time to predict customer churn faster

### Variety: 
Big data is any type of data - structured and unstructured data such as text, sensor data, audio, video, click streams, log files and more. New insights are found when analyzing these data types together.
Monitor 100’s of live video feeds from surveillance cameras to target points of interest
Exploit the 80% data growth in images, video and documents to improve customer satisfaction

### Veracity: 
1 in 3 business leaders don’t trust the information they use to make decisions. How can you act upon information if you don’t trust it? Establishing trust in big data presents a huge challenge as the variety and number of sources grows.

big data means ‘the art of possible'.我的理解是数据仓库和BI，在非数据库（非关系型数据库）维度的扩展。
举了个很生动的例子：google trend可以让我们不需要调查和研究，就知道哪里发生了什么事。

## SaaS
然后说了下云计算，既SaaS (software as service), 它包括： 	
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) 	
PaaS (Platform as service) 	
Maas (Middleware as service) 	

SaaS 将软件和服务融合起来，开辟了一种新的商业模式。这一块我比较了解，可惜大爱的google和amazon在国内都被墙着。。。
