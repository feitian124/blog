According to the [offical website](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html): 
`Bootstrap` is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework.        
Made for faster and easier web development.
How to put Bootstrap to use? Simple! Just download the bootstrap.

Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder to see the structure of (the compiled) Bootstrap. You'll see something like this:  
![Bootstrap structure](/images/Bootstrap.png)
And use it as the external normal `.css` file and `.js` file. Like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
    	<head>
            <title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- Bootstrap -->
            <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
    	</head>
    	<body>
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
            <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    	</body>
	</html>
```

And you're set! With those two files added, you can begin to develop any site or application with Bootstrap.
Bootstrap is built on responsive 12-column grids, layouts, and components.
Bootstrap provided us fantastic css style for all kinds of components. And we have many options to choose.
